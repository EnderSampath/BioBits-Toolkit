Hello user!!!!
Let me give you some story time!!
Back in my time, when I was studying for USABO, a major hurdle that I had to face was the lack of resources.
It took a lot of time to be able to find resources, study guides, tips, and tricks to memorize various proceses.
To make sure others do not need to face as much hurdles as I had, this repository will be able to provide you with practice tests, study notes for each Campbell Chapter, etc.
I hope you are able to have an easier time with this repository and please contact me ig if there is anything you would like to add or change ✔️
